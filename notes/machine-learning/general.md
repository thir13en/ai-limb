# Machine Learning (ML)

### What is ML?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from and making decisions based on data. It defines a set of methods that improve the behavior of a system based on accumulated experience. Essentially, ML enables computers to learn and adapt through experience without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. This evolving capability makes ML integral to various applications, from simple daily tasks like email filtering to complex operations like autonomous driving.

### Common Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning:** This is the most prevalent type of machine learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means it works with data that includes both the input and the desired output. The goal is for the model to learn to map inputs to outputs, making it ideal for applications like spam detection or image classification.

2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms deal with unlabeled data. The system tries to learn the underlying structure from the input data, categorizing or grouping data points based on similarities or differences without any prior knowledge of the outcomes. It’s widely used in clustering and association tasks, like customer segmentation in marketing.

3. **Reinforcement Learning:** This type of learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific context. Reinforcement learning is different from supervised learning in that it doesn’t need labeled input/output pairs and is not just about finding a function to map input to output but about learning a series of actions.

Each of these types has its unique methods and applications, making machine learning a versatile and evolving field. The choice of learning method depends on the task, the available data, and the desired outcome. With the continuous advancements in technology and data availability, machine learning is becoming increasingly sophisticated and integral to various industries and sectors.
